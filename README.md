# 🌾 FasalDrishti

> **An Offline-First, AI-Powered Geospatial Intelligence Platform for Precision Agriculture.**

**FasalDrishti** is a mission-critical tool designed for farmers and agronomists operating in low-connectivity environments. It combines satellite imagery, localized field data, and AI diagnosis into a single "Command Center" for crop health.

_The FasalDrishti Command Center showing 10,000+ data points clustered for performance._

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📡 Core Connectivity & Sync

- **Offline-First Architecture:** Continue working without internet. Data is queued in IndexedDB and syncs automatically when connection is restored.
- **Optimistic UI:** Instant feedback. Markers appear immediately ("Ghost Markers") while uploading in the background.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** "Live Mode" uses short-polling (SWR strategy) to sync data between multiple farmers working on the same field.

### 🗺️ Advanced Geospatial Analysis

- **High-Performance Mapping:** Renders **10,000+ plant markers** at 60fps using Supercluster aggregation.
- **Geofencing & Polygon Analysis:** Draw field boundaries to calculate localized crop statistics using **Turf.js**.
- **Time-Travel Engine:** Scroll through historical data to visualize crop evolution over seasons.

_Geofencing a specific field to analyze crop density and health within the boundary._

### 🧠 AI & Diagnostics

- **On-Device Pre-processing:** Images are compressed and resized in the browser (using Web Workers) before upload.
- **AI Diagnosis:** Integrated AI analysis to auto-detect crop type (Corn, Wheat, etc.) and health status (Pest, Disease, Water Stress).
- **Split-View Comparison:** "Before & After" slider to compare the exact same geocoordinate across different dates.

_Comparing crop health before and after treatment using the historical slider._

## 🏗️ Architectural Decisions & Engineering Impact

We didn’t just build features; we solved engineering constraints. Below is the breakdown of our technical strategy:

| Challenge                                              | Architectural Decision              | Implementation Detail                                                                                                                                                             | Quantifiable Impact                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network Instability** _(Farms have poor 4G)_         | **Offline-First Queue (IndexedDB)** | Custom Redux middleware intercepts failed `500`/network errors and serializes actions to IndexedDB. A background listener flushes the queue when `navigator.onLine` becomes true. | **0% data loss.** Users can map an entire field in airplane mode and sync later. |
| **Rendering Bottlenecks** _(Map lag with 1k+ markers)_ | **Supercluster Aggregation**        | Uses a K-D tree (Supercluster) to aggregate points based on zoom level and viewport bounds instead of rendering individual DOM nodes.                                             | **60 FPS rendering.** Reduced DOM nodes by **~95%** at zoom level 4.             |
| **List Performance** _(Sidebar lagging)_               | **Windowing / Virtualization**      | Implemented `react-window` to render only the visible ~10 list items and recycle DOM nodes during scroll.                                                                         | **O(1) memory usage** regardless of list size (10 vs 10,000 items).              |
| **User-Perceived Latency**                             | **Optimistic Updates**              | Redux store updates immediately on user action; state is rolled back only if the server rejects the final sync.                                                                   | **< 50 ms interaction time.** Uploads feel instant despite 2–3 s server latency. |
| **Large Image Uploads**                                | **Client-Side Compression**         | `browser-image-compression` runs off the main thread to resize 4K images into optimized web assets before upload.                                                                 | **~80% bandwidth savings.** Reduced payload from ~5 MB to ~800 KB.               |

## 🔌 API Integration Logic

FasalDrishti integrates with the Alumnx Hackathon API to persist geospatial data. The sync engine handles the following endpoints:

### 1. Extract GPS Metadata

Used immediately after image selection to populate the "Add Plant" modal.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/hackathons/extract-latitude-longitude`
- **Purpose:** Parses EXIF data from the uploaded image.

### 2. Save Plant Data (Sync & Offline Queue)

This endpoint is triggered by the `uploadPlant` thunk. If offline, the payload is serialized to IndexedDB.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/hackathons/save-plant-location-data`
- **Payload:**

```json
{
  "emailId": "farmer@gmail.com",
  "imageName": "corn_field_01.jpg",
  "imageUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
  "latitude": 15.97048,
  "longitude": 79.27811
}
```

### 3. Fetch Farm Data (Visualization)

Called on app initialization (`useEffect`) and periodic polling ("Live Mode").

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/hackathons/get-plant-location-data`
- **Response:** Returns an array of GeoJSON-compatible plant objects.

---

## 📸 Usage Guide

### 1. The Map Board (Command Center)

- **Navigation:** Use the top-right controls to Zoom, Tilt, and Geolocate.
- **Clustering:** Zoom out to see grouped "bubbles." Click a cluster to zoom in.
- **Filtering:** Use the **Time Slider** at the bottom to filter crops by planting date.

### 2. Adding Data (Offline Capable)

1. Click the **"Upload Plant"** button (or drag & drop).
2. The AI will auto-analyze the image for pests/diseases.
3. Click **Upload**.

- _If Online:_ It syncs instantly.
- _If Offline:_ It enters the **Sync Queue** (Yellow Badge) and auto-uploads later.

### 3. Analytics & Tools

- **Draw Tool:** Click the Hexagon icon to draw a field boundary. The app will calculate how many plants are inside that specific zone.
- **Inventory:** Open the sidebar to see a virtualized list of all crops.
- **Comparison:** Click a plant, then check "Location History" to launch the **Split-Screen Slider**.
